  Old growth trees are trees that are at least 150 years old. Because of their old age, old growth trees are extremly rare since their wood is top notch. In B.C Canada, only 3 percent of the original productive old growth still exsits! What is even more sad is that loggers are still targeting the reamining trees. This is why we all need to do our part in helping ban the felling of old growth trees </FONT>
