  <h1>Old Growth Logging</h1>
<FONT COLOR="Black"> 
  An old growth tree is targeted by loggers for the great value of the wood. There are no knots, the wood is straight, and the growth rings are close together. There is nothing wrong with the sustainable harvest of second growth tree which are around 80 years old, but cutting down a 1000+ year old tree is just wrong. These forests are also beautiful! They support massive ecosystems, and store a lot of carbon. Old growth forests are are magical to be in, and it is so sad how 1000 years of progress can all be lost in one day </FONT>
